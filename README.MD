# LLM Direct Toolkit Suite

The LLM Direct Toolkit Suite is a robust armory of tools designed to facilitate and enhance direct interaction with our Language Learning Model (LLM). This suite features the OpenAI Direct Call Tool, an innovative tool that establishes a direct line of communication to various models of the OpenAI GPT series.

## OpenAI Direct Call Tool

The OpenAI Direct Call Tool in the LLM Direct Toolkit Suite provides a user-friendly and efficient way to interact directly with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models. Users can specify the desired GPT model, such as 'gpt-3.5-turbo' or 'gpt-4,' and present a desired message to which the model would respond. They can provide an optional system setting that describes the AI's intended role or persona and additional structured data can also be included for more advanced interactions.

Once a call is made using the tool, it retrieves the OpenAI API Key, establishes interaction with the chosen model, packages the user-provided inputs into the appropriate format for the Chat API, and returns the model's response. Should it encounter any errors while running the API or communicating with the model, a prompt user-friendly exception message will be displayed, ensuring smooth operation.

This sophisticated toolkit not just fuels OpenAI model interactions but also establishes a conduit for effective communication, thereby enabling users to easily leverage OpenAI's learning models for desired automation and augmentation tasks.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### üõ† **Setting Up of SuperAGI**
Set up SuperAGI by following the instructions given (https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI/blob/main/README.MD)

You'll be able to use the Pyppeteer Web Scraper Tool on the fly once you have setup SuperAGI.

## Running LLM Direct Toolkit Suite

You can simply ask your agent to use an LLM to execute a step.  It should find the plugin and choose the best LLM and model to use.
